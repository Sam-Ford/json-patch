# json-patch

JsonPatchDocument extensions for .NET 5.0. The JsonPatchDocument from Microsoft doesn't support generating patches by comparing to json objects (diff). This is intended to provide that functionality. Very early stages and riddled with bugs currently. Will be made into a Nuget package when it's stable
